Introduction to Java Script

We have 8 concepts that we will be focusing on : 
1. We have variables and Data Types : variables in JavaScript you declare variables using 'var','let', or 'const'. 'var' has function scope , while 'let' and 'const' have block scope. While 'let' and 'const' have block scope.
2. DATA TYPES : javaScript suports various data types including numbers , strings, booleans , arrays, objects,functions and more.
3. FUNCTIONS: Are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They can be declared using the 'FUNCTION' keyword as a arrow functions ('()=>{}').
4. Functions can take parameters and return values . They can also be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions (higher order functions).

5. HOW TO ADD A COMMENT ON JAVA SCRIPT: you can add comments to your code to provide explainations, documentation, or to temporarily disabled code. There are two main ways to add comments: Single-line comments : use '//' to add comments that span single line. below its how to add comment:
  // This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // This comment explains the purpose of the variable x

MMULTI-LINE COMMENTS : Enclose comments within '/* */' to create multi-line comments. 
/* This is a multi-line comment
   that spans multiple lines */
let y = 10;

Here are some best practices for using comments in JavaScript:

Be descriptive: Write comments that explain the purpose of the code, especially if it's not immediately obvious from the code itself.
Avoid unnecessary comments: Comments should add value to the code by providing insights or explanations that are not self-evident.
Update comments: Remember to update comments when you modify the code to keep them accurate and relevant.
Use comments sparingly: Write code that is self-explanatory and easy to understand without relying too heavily on comments.
